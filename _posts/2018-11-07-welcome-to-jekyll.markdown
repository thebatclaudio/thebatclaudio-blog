**It's always the same.** Everytime I open a new blog **I don't know how to start my first post** *.
<!--more-->

I'm **Claudio La Barbera**, a **web developer** based in **Palermo**. 

I love IT since I was a child: I watched with amazement **Amiga 600 videogames** and my father browsing the web with a **56k**. 

Now, between commits I like to play my guitar, read my comic books (specially **Batman**) and watch good films.

This is my new blog and here I will talk about whatever will pops into my head. I was tired to use **Wordpress**, so I'm starting this new adventure with **Jekyll** and trying to adapt the template to [my website](https://thebatclaud.io).

Bye.
